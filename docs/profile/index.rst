Profiles are personal data for accounts. They can be shared with other accounts or used for storing own data. This section contains modules for maintaining profile and interacting with profiles from other accounts.

Two types of profiles are supported:

- personal `profiles <profile.html>`_, that hold users data like contacts, bookmarks, encryption keys
- `business center profiles <business-center-profile.html>`_, that are like contact cards and hold data intended for other participants
