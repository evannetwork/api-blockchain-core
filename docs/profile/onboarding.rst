The onboarding process is used to enable users to invite other users, where no blockchain account id is known. It allows to send an email to such contacts, that contains a link. This link points to a evan.network √êApp, that allows accept the invitation by either creating a new account or by accepting it with an existing account.

It uses the `Key Exchange <key-exchange.html>`_ module described in the last section for its underlying key exchange process but moves the process of creating a new communication key to the invited user.

To get in contact with a user via email, a smart agent is used. This smart agent has to be added as a contact and a regular key exchange with the smart agent is performed. The agent accepts the invitation automatically and the inviting user sends a bmail (blockchain mail) with the contact details of the user, that should be invited, and an amount of welcome EVEs to the smart agent.

The onboarding smart creates a session on his end and sends an email to the invited user, that includes the session token, with which the invited user can claim the welcome EVEs.

The invited user now creates or confirms an account and start the key exchange process on his or her end. The rest of the flow is as described in `Key Exchange <key-exchange.html>`_.

To start the process at from the inviting users side, make sure that this user has exchanged keys with the onboarding smart agent.
