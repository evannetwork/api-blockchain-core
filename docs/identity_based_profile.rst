Identity Based Profile
======================

On the evan.network a profile is simply a `Link Data Contract <https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/concepts/data-contract.html>`_. The data can be initialy by the owner of the profile but when `Link permissions <https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/concepts/smart-contract-permissioning.html>`_ are granted other members can also the data. Similarly to under stand what an identity based profile is we need to look into roles and permissions. An identity based profile is also a data contract but the owner of the data contract is another contract which we shall call the identity contract. The previous implementations were all account based profiles on the evan.network but now all the new users will be using identity based profiles.

When an account requests for an identity based profile, A random 32 bytes address(profile) is generated and this is then linked to the identity and this is mapped to the account which becomes the owner of this identity based profile. All functionalities generating address, linking the identity and mapping the owner are provided using the IdentityHolder contract. Once this identity based profile has been created then this profile is added to the user registry.

When using identities we will come accross three important terminologies. `activeIdentity` and `underlyingAccount` and `activeAccount`. A single user can have multiple identities and the identity being used is known as the activeIdentity. The account which is used to execute the transaction for the identity is known as the underlyingAccount. Finally multiple accounts can delegate a single identity and the account which is using the identity is known as the activeAccount.

Further more these identities can be converted into DIDs using the :doc:`DID <did>`_ module and they can issue and be issued verifiable credentials using the :doc:`VC <vc>`_ module.

Configuring to use identity based profile
=========================================

Identity based profiles are the entities which act on behalf of an account. All transactions are done via the the underlying account for the identity however the transaction objects are prepared using the identity. Configuring a runtime to use identity based profile is similar to the process of creating a runtime which uses account based profile as discussed in (getting started)[/getting-started.html#create-a-new-profile-on-evan-network-via-api]

.. code-block:: javascript

    // require blockchain-core dependencies
    const Web3 = require('web3');

    // require blockchain-core
    const { Ipfs, createDefaultRuntime } = require('@evan.network/api-blockchain-core');

    const runtimeConfig = {
      // account map to blockchain accounts with their private key
      accountMap: {
        'ACCOUNTID':
          'PRIVATE KEY',
      },
      // key configuration for private data handling
      keyConfig: {
        'ACCOUNTID': 'PASSWORD',
      },
      // use identity flag for using identity based profiles
      useIdentity: true,
      // ipfs configuration for evan.network storage
      ipfs: {host: 'ipfs.test.evan.network', port: '443', protocol: 'https'},
      // web3 provider config (currently evan.network testcore)
      web3Provider: 'wss://testcore.evan.network/ws',
    };


    async function init() {
      // initialize dependencies
      const provider = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(
        runtimeConfig.web3Provider,
        { clientConfig: { keepalive: true, keepaliveInterval: 5000 } });
      const web3 = new Web3(provider, null, { transactionConfirmationBlocks: 1 });
      const dfs = new Ipfs({ dfsConfig: runtimeConfig.ipfs });

      // create runtime
      const runtime = await createDefaultRuntime(web3, dfs, { accountMap: runtimeConfig.accountMap, keyConfig: runtimeConfig.keyConfig, useIdentity: runtimeConfig.useIdentity });
      console.dir(runtime);
    }

    init();

Now you can use an a `runtime` object which uses an identity as an execution point to interact with the evan.network blockchain.
